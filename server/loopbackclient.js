/**
 * This pseudo socket used to manage system level stuff. It
 * masqueraes as both a `WSClient` as defined in
 * WebSocketServer.js and as a 'WebSocketClient` as normally
 * defined in virutalsocket.js
 *
 * In other words, normally a WSClient is a server side object
 * and a WebSocketClient is a client side object. Data is passed
 * between them.
 *
 * This object those exists only on the server to simulate
 * a connection between the 2 things but allows the client
 * to stay on the server.
