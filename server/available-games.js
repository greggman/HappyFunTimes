// This is effectively a wrapper for lib/gamedb except we can add games

// that have not been installed/added.

// This happens if we run a game directly, especially from unity. Because
// the game is not installed/added it won't show up at http://localhost:18679/games.html
// but unity can still start a game and send a message to happyFunTimes
