Title: Ideas
Description: Ideas to spur more ideas. Innovated ways to use HappyFunTimes

At the time I wrote this "ideas" document I hadn't made many games. I've spent
the last 4 months making infrustucture. But, there's a ton of ideas. I'm sure
you have more but just throw some ideas out and get yourself imagining stuff...

First off, the 3 *games* I've made so far, PowPow, BoomBoom, JumpJump are basically
classic games with more players. But, with a system like HappyFunTimes where you
can have 10, 20, 50, 100 players other things come to mind.

For example playing JumpJump with 25 players is barely managable. Too many people
are on the screen. But what about team games? 5 people per team? What about
social games? Ask people to go around the room and click things on each other's phones
or find stuff.

So some random ideas I'd like to explore if I have time. Maybe they'll trigger some
ideas for you

*   Sequences by team

    Each team member's phone shows a symbol.
    The symbol needed for that team is shown. That team member member needs to press their button
    If the wrong team member presses their button the team has to start over
    First team wins?

    Simple example: show a hurdle race. Each hurdle has a symbol above it. Each person
    on a team has 1 symbol on their phone. For that team to advance the person with
    the matching symbol has to press their button to jump the hurdle.

    Complications:

    *   each player on each team needs a unique symbol. If one someone on a
        team quits that symbol needs to be removed. If a play joins in the middle they need
        to be added.

    *   given a lot of player per team most team members have nothing to do


*   Spider game

    One button. Players are at edge of screen. Shoot line across
    screen and then travel down line to where it touches other edge of
    screen. If any other player touches their line they die.

    Q: How long do the lines last? 1 second? Forever?

    Q: How to aim? Auto sweep? Tilt phone?

*   using orientation use phone as a laser pointer

    make team laser pointer game

*   Coreography game

    Computer calls 4-8 people up "It's your turn". Displays a diagram "[1 2 3 4]" on the big screen and tells each player
    which number to stand on on their phone. Players are instructed to plugin headphones and put them on, make sure their
    phone won't turn off and press a button when they can hear the sound.

    Computer then plays dance music on the TV and gives each player individual dance instructions in their headphones
    for a coreographied dance.

*   Shake phone to race

    The faster you shake the faster it goes

*   Fly ship in 2d using orienation. Hold buttons to spread particles, effects, interact
    Have glow or other interaction when players touch, 2, 3, 4 etc.

*   Balance platforms with balls melodic.

    Each player controls one platform they can place and rotate with their phone. Balls bounce off them,
    Or rain producing sounds. Think elektroplancton

*   Bucket brigade

    Players have to pass things from player to player either on the big screen or on their own.
    Divide into teams. Red (A, B, C, D) vs Blue (A, B, C, D). A and B have to press at the same time?
    Then B and C, then C and D. But must let off? Controls could be just L<->R. Or just one button.
    Hold for Left, release for Right. But, discourage just mashing the button some how

*   Given at least 4 players divide into groups.

    Make up phone configuration in gamer. Tell users to arrange their phones.

    Put a number on each phone and a diagram

         +----+
         |    |    +----+
         | 1  +----+    |
         |    |    | 3  |
         +----+ 2  |    |
              |    +----+
              +----+

    Then, players push a character from on phone to the next or flick a ball.
    Teams that make the most laps win or points win

*   Number the phones, have players stand in a circle by number.

    Play some Kind of pass the ball game where the server passes things around
    the circle and players have to forward them. Maybe like pong ?
    Maybe with orientation ? Maybe catch with basket then throw?

    If players stand I circle could let players target each other because can guess
    where they are in relation to each other

    Could limit to groups of ~12, split groups?

*   Game that players lineup their screens to figure out code. Maybe color background by team/group


*   Go Fish

    Collect every pair of cards? There are 2 of each card. Walk around the room and
    exchange cards. Maybe the shared screens shows who's in lead or number of cards
    to go or soethng.

    Need to know if I can do it.

    Maybe you have to bump phones, then it says "paired with <name>". Then you can
    ask "do you have any 4s?"  "Go fish!"  You each ask for a card, then it exchanges,
    then it unpairs and you can't pair with the same person until you've paired with
    someone else?

    How can I make it social. I'd prefer if you can't cheat so you'd pick the card
    on your screen you want to match. And it would tell you? Or maybe the other person
    would have to answer but if they lie there's some penalty or something?

*   Fist bump game

    using accelerometers and synced clock maybe we can tell when
    two people fist bump? Heck, maybe if 3 or more people have
    the same time stamp we can assume all of them bumped?

    Players have to fist bump everyone?

*   Games with physical movements

    Players must turn around (use compass / device orientation).
    Of course players can just turn their phones. Maybe they have
    to hold them level (put dot on the screen with a circle, keep
    circle in the dot as they are instructed to turn left, turn right,
    jump, etc...

    Maybe it's a group dance.

*   Just press button most times?

    various track and field / hyper bishi bashi games

*   Find your name on other person's phone. Fist bump.

*   Find your picture on other person's phone.

    iOS Safari can't do pictures yet

*   game where players have to find matching piece of puzzle.

    Example for groups of 3 players they might see

         +---+  +---+  +---+   Picture of 3 phones side by side.
         |   |  |   |  |   |   with some image that fits just those
         | <-|  |-O-|  |-> |   3 phones.
         |   |  |   |  |   |
         |   |  |   |  |   |
         +---+  +---+  +---+

    You have to walk around the room and find your matching partners.
    Maybe make it easier by matching background colors. First find all the red players,
    then figure how to align the phones to see the image.

    Not sure what you'd do at that point. Type the message that's across N
    displays. Or maybe trace some line across all 3? Hard to do unless you
    set the phones down.

*   game where you slide character from one phone to the other by sliding finger across both phones

    Variation of above idea. If you know 2 phones are partners then you could slide
    your finger from one to the other to drag a character across screens. The game would
    know the 2 controllers belong together and based on time (syncedclock) and where fingers
    are dragged could tell if you dragged from the correct N phones.

*   Racing up or down screen using device orientation for steering

*   Use device orientation like a paddle controller. Tilting left
    right moves basket across screen. Pressing button puts your
    basket high for a moment. Try to catch more falling things than other
    players? Think Kaboom

*   drawing game.

    Player's draw on their phone, add drawing to level? Maybe Crayon Physics like?
    Heck, just stop erasing the canvas with the simple example. Problem. Penises

*   racing game

    maybe like micro machines or moto roader where the camera keeps up with the lead
    and others get put in place.

    like grand prix, tiny cars on a track the fits on the screen

*   More co-op games or team games.

*   rapunzel

    Rapunzel was a basic programming tutorial where you'd be told the wind
    and height above ground of Rapunzel's window and you'd have to type in
    the angle and power of the bow to shoot an arrow into her window.

    That's been updated by a zillion people into showing little cannons
    trying to hit each other and having easier input. Well, a ton-o-players
    playing it. Could use orientation to aim cannon.

*   johann sabastian joust?

    johann sabastian joust is a game played with move controllers
    where you try not to move the controller too much or you're out.
    Other players try to make you move to fast knocking you out while
    at the same time trying not to get taken out themselves.

    HTML5 allows access to the accelerometers of the phone so it
    should be possible ot make a similar game with HFT.

    Apparently they aren't happy about clones

*   Games where each player gets a different contoller.

    Players have different roles

*   quiz

    send question Q + 4 answers, display on phone and on game. On game show counts
    In 10 seconds show correct answer and winner on game and on phone?
    Make sure answers after game has moved on do not affect results
    Add score for players

*   Device orientation game, each player is assigned a piece of a shape, they have
    to rotate their device to get the shape to line up (ie, jigsaw puzzle). Anytime
    a new player is added the current shape is subdivided.

*   Use device motion to play tennis like Wii (shake controller to return ball)

*   Use the Speech Synthesis API

    Players plug in headphones and put them in just one ear. The game sends commands/advice/direction
    to the controller which instructs each player secretly using the speech API. This way they
    can look at the game (the TV) and still get individual and private instruction on what to do.

    Not sure the speech API is available on phones but you could use audio files
    "Walk forward", "turn left", "jump", "wave", "tap the person on your right"
    or longer "You're the spy. Try to find the player with the red screen and press it"

*   Grab for all

    Just put stuff on the screen, people grab it as fast as they can (same controls as simple?)
    or maybe a grid of buttons? Characters that rotate and jump? Highest score wins. Bombs
    fail

*   Skeet ball or mega bowling

    Everyone uses their phone to flick their ball up the screen trying to get more points or knock over more pins

*   Nation ball / Dodge Ball

    players in the middle must dog things. Players knocked out throw things in to knock other players out

*   Go on adventure in the room.

    Your phone lists what you need to find and what you have to give. People go around the room
    trying to find the next thing in their fetch quest

*   Use led tapes across room to visually display portals. Jump in portal on 1 computer, see light
    go across tape. Arrive at other computer

*   draw pattern, thing follows pattern

*   sequence across phones. Each phone screams at random?

*   Give everyone different controls

    Give them N seconds to do their thing. Then show graph/percent of people who finished.
    Figure out way for crowd to route for each other trying to get 100%

*   Sorting game

    Each player gets a letter (or a number). Make teams by color. Players press left or right
    to swap position. First team to get their team in order wins. Fun? More than Once?

*   Find your symbol.

    Inspired by Alistar Aitcheson's games, each player is assigned a symbol. Sock, Ball, Chicken, Bat,
    The symbols appear on the screen in different ways. Players must press their button when they
    see their symbol but not press it when there symbol is not visible.

*   Find matching background.

    Find the player with the matching background. Click button on your screen that matches
    one on theirs. Each screen shows 4 buttons. Only one matches. When you press the correct
    one you get a point. Press the wrong one lose a point. After pressing your background
    and images change so you have to find others? Not sure how to do that last part since
    others are looking for your background. Maybe two people are always looking for each other?
    Since there are 4 symbols is there a way to make all 4 of those people have to find each
    other?

*   Co-op tetris

    Except figure out a way good players can power up and help bad players. Maybe they can
    start shooting. Maybe have teams so there's an insentive to help teammates (don't want to
    lose to other team)

*   Press to not DIE!

    Some kind of game where it shows a video or something and then someone screams "ABUNAI!!!"
    If you have to press your button or the right button within 1 seconds or you fail. Show
    precent of people that succeeded. Teams might make it competative.

*   Artillary game

    Players are divided into teams. Each team has a castle. UI is slingshot. Tilt phone to aim
    Draw string to set power, Release to fire. Projectiles of one team all come from same castle.

    Could make this asymetric where some players control shields or the movement of the base.
    or get different weapons

*   Chanting game

    Could you make a game where when the phone flashes and makes a noise the player is
    supposed to lift their hands and shout. Computer would conduct players in a chant
    some people saying "Ooga" others saying "Chaka" etc....

    Ideally you wouldn't have to look at the phone. Look into sounds that rumble the phone.
