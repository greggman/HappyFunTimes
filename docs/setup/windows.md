## Problems with Windows code signing

As of Windows 8 programs for Windows need to be "code signed". Signing costs $200-$500 a year
which for an open source project is very *NOT COOL*. If anyone knows how to get a cheaper
open source project code signed please contact me.

What this means to you is when installing in Windows you might run into issues. Here's how to get
around them.

Go to your Downloads folder and double click the installer. You'll probably get a message something like

![Windows Protection](http://blog.happyfuntimes.net/images/windows-protection-racket.jpg "Windows Protection")

Click "More" and you'll see this.

![Windows Warning](http://blog.happyfuntimes.net/images/windows-warning.jpg "Windows Warning")

Click "Run Anyway". After that you'll have to find HappyFunTimes. On the start screen there's a tiny message at the bottom

![Windows New Apps](http://blog.happyfuntimes.net/images/windows-new-apps.jpg "Windows Apps")

After that you'll find it under `H`
