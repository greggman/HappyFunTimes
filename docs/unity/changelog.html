        <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-8 docs-content">

            <ul>
<li><p>2.0</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make it 100% self contained.</p>
<p>No more need for node.js. Now you can easily build using the normal builder
and post your games on itch.io or steam, etc...</p>
</li>
<li><p>Move almost all the samples into the plugin.</p>
<p>Before each sample was a separate repo. This was to make it easy to export
and install each one into the HappyFunTimes app. Now that it&#39;s all
standalone there&#39;s no need for that feature and all the samples can
happily co-exist in the same project.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>1.3</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fixed <code>GetAxis</code> bug where asking for the wrong axis returned the first axis</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added Instructions support.</p>
<p>Start HappyFunTimes with <code>hft start --instrutions</code> for instructions to appear.
<a href="commands.html#-hft-start-">See docs</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>1.2</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Added Export/Install/Publish menu items</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added HFTGamepad.BUTTON_TOUCH for whether or not the user is touching the screen
on the orientation and touch controllers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Added ability to play sound through controller</p>
<p>There are currently 2 ways to make sounds for the controllers.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>JSFX</p>
<p>This is the recommended way as it&#39;s light weight.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Go to the <a href="http://egonelbre.com/project/jsfx/">JSFX sound maker</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Adjust the values until you get a sound you like.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Copy the sound values (near top of the page just below the buttons) to a text file with the extension &quot;.jsfx.txt&quot;
putting a name in front of each set of values. Save that file in Assets/WebPlayerTemplates/HappyFunTimes</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For example here is the sample <code>sounds.jsfx.txt</code> file</p>

<li><p>Use sounds files</p>
<p>Put sound files (<code>.mp3</code> or <code>.wav</code>) in <code>Assets/WebPlayerTemplates/HappyFunTimes/sounds</code>
They have to be in there because they must be served to the phone. Note that it&#39;s a
good idea to keep them as small as possible because each time a player connects to
the game his phone will have to download all the sounds. JSFX sounds comming soon.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="playing-sounds">Playing Sounds</h2>
<p>To use the sounds, on some global gameobject (like LevelManager in all the samples)
add an <code>HFTGlobalSoundHelper</code> script component.</p>
<p>Then, on the prefab that gets spawned for your players, the same prefab you put
an <code>HFTInput</code> or <code>HFTGamepad</code> script component add the <code>HFTSoundPlayer</code> script
component.</p>
<p>In your <code>Awake</code> or <code>Start</code> look it up</p>
<pre><code>private HFTSoundPlayer m_soundPlayer;

void Awake()
{
     m_soundPlayer = GetComponent&lt;HFTSoundPlayer&gt;();
}
</code></pre><p>To play a sound call <code>m_soundPlayer.PlaySound</code> with the name of the sound (no extension).
In other words if you have <code>sounds/explosion.mp3</code> then you can trigger that sound on
the user&#39;s phone with</p>
<pre><code>m_soundPlayer.PlaySound(&quot;explosion&quot;);
</code></pre><p>Or if you named a JSFX sound like</p>
<pre><code>bounce    [&quot;noise&quot;,0.0000,1.0000,0.0000,0.0220,0.0000,0.1480,20.0000,309.0000,2400.0000,-0.3300,0.0000,0.0000,0.0100,0.0003,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,1.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000]
</code></pre><p>Then</p>
<pre><code>m_soundPlayer.PlaySound(&quot;bounce&quot;);

<pre><code>*   added mulit-touch support to HFTInput via the standard `GetTouch` function
    as well as `axes` and `buttons`

        public const int AXIS_TOUCH0_X = 13;
        public const int AXIS_TOUCH0_Y = 14;

        public const int AXIS_TOUCH8_X = 29;
        public const int AXIS_TOUCH8_Y = 30;
        public const int AXIS_TOUCH9_X = 31;
        public const int AXIS_TOUCH9_Y = 32;

        public const int BUTTON_TOUCH0 = 18;
        public const int BUTTON_TOUCH1 = 19;
        public const int BUTTON_TOUCH2 = 20;
        public const int BUTTON_TOUCH3 = 21;
        public const int BUTTON_TOUCH4 = 22;
        public const int BUTTON_TOUCH5 = 23;
        public const int BUTTON_TOUCH6 = 24;

        public const int BUTTON_TOUCH9 = 27;

    Note: The Touch.rawPosition is currently in screen pixels of Unity
    not the controller. It&#39;s not clear what the best way to handle this
    is.

    The Unity `Input` API says those value are in pixels but they are
    assuming the game is running on the phone. In the case of HappyFunTimes
    though each phone is different so having it be in phone screen pixels
    would make no sense unless you also knew the resolution of each phone.
    I could provide that but that would make it more complicated for you.

    Personally I&#39;d prefer normalized values (0.0 to 1.0). If you want those
    then take  `Touch.rawPosition` and divide `x` by `Screen.width` and `y` by `Screen.height`
    as in

        HFTInput.Touch touch = m_hftInput.GetTouch(0);
        float normalizedX = touch.x / Screen.width;
        float normalziedY = touch.y / Screen.height;

    Also note the AXIS versions of these are already normalized to
    a -1.0 to +1.0 range.

*   Changed sample HFTGamepad code to not issue an error if it&#39;s not actually
    connected to a controller.

    Users often leave a prefab in their scene. That prefab would generate
    errors because it&#39;s not actually connected to a controller and was
    trying to access the controllers `NetPlayer`.
