            <p>To be clear, if you make your own custom controllers you can play sounds any way you&#39;d
like. This document is specifically about playing sounds from the sample <a href="gamepad.html">Gamepad controller</a></p>
<h2 id="making-sounds">Making Sounds</h2>
<p>There are currently 2 ways to make sounds for the sample gamepad controllers.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>JSFX</p>
<p>This is the recommended way as it&#39;s light weight.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Go to the <a href="http://egonelbre.com/project/jsfx/">JSFX sound maker</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Adjust the values until you get a sound you like.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Copy the sound values (near top of the page just below the buttons) to a text file with the extension &quot;.jsfx.txt&quot;
putting a name in front of each set of values. Save that file some where below
<code>Assets/WebPlayerTemplates/HappyFunTimes</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For example here is the sample <code>sounds.jsfx.txt</code> file</p>
<pre><code>coin      [&quot;square&quot;,0.0000,0.4000,0.0000,0.0240,0.4080,0.3480,20.0000,909.0000,2400.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0100,0.0003,0.0000,0.2540,0.1090,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,1.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000]

</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Use sounds files</p>
<p>Put sound files (<code>.mp3</code> or <code>.wav</code>) somewhere below <code>Assets/WebPlayerTemplates/HappyFunTimes</code>
They have to be in there because they must be served to the phone.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: it&#39;s a good idea to keep them as small as possible because each time a player connects to
the game the phone will have to download all the sounds.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="playing-sounds">Playing Sounds</h2>
<p>To use the sounds:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>On some global gameobject (like LevelManager in all the samples)
add an <code>HFTGlobalSoundHelper</code> script component.</p>
<p>This component scans for and loads the sounds from all folders below <code>Assets/WebPlayerTemplates/HappyFunTimes</code>
looking for <code>.mp3</code> and <code>.wav</code> and <code>.jsfx.txt</code> files</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the prefab that gets spawned for your players, the same prefab you put
an <code>HFTInput</code> or <code>HFTGamepad</code> script component add the <code>HFTSoundPlayer</code> script
component.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In your <code>Awake</code> or <code>Start</code> look up the <code>HFTSoundPlayer</code> component</p>
<pre><code>private HFTSoundPlayer m_soundPlayer;

void Awake()
{
     m_soundPlayer = GetComponent&lt;HFTSoundPlayer&gt;();
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>To play a sound call <code>m_soundPlayer.PlaySound</code> with the name of the sound (no extension).
In other words if you have <code>sounds/explosion.mp3</code> then you can trigger that sound on
the user&#39;s phone with</p>
<pre><code>m_soundPlayer.PlaySound(&quot;explosion&quot;);
</code></pre><p>Or if you named a JSFX sound like</p>
<pre><code>bounce    [&quot;noise&quot;,0.0000,1.0000,0.0000,0.0220,0.0000,0.1480,20.0000,309.0000,2400.0000,-0.3300,0.0000,0.0000,0.0100,0.0003,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,1.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000]
</code></pre><p>Then</p>
<pre><code>m_soundPlayer.PlaySound(&quot;bounce&quot;);
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>That&#39;s it!</p>
<h2 id="names-must-be-unique-">Names must be Unique!</h2>
<p>Note that sounds are referenced by name only so you can&#39;t have 2 sounds with the same filename
even if they are in different folders. Simiarly they can&#39;t clash with the names in the sounds.jsfx.txt
file. So for example if you look at the example sounds.jsfx.txt file above you&#39;ll see there&#39;s a sound
called <code>coin</code>. That would conflict with a sound file called <code>coin.mp3</code>.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t like those limits see <code>HFTGlobalSoundHelper.cs</code>, <code>HFTSoundPlayer.cs</code>, and <code>HTFSounds.cs</code> as well
as the corresponding support in <code>Assets/WebPlayerTemplates/HappyFunTimes/controllers/gamepad/scripts/controller.js</code>
and edit or better copy them and add your own features.</p>
